# How well do existing algos perform on the task?

We've evaluated several existing algos:

- prior inpainting ([notebook](https://github.com/RomanPlusPlus/netReconst/blob/main/reconstruction_notebooks/prior_inpainting201106_c.ipynb))
- scikit inpainting ([notebook](https://github.com/RomanPlusPlus/netReconst/blob/main/reconstruction_notebooks/scikit_inpainting201202.ipynb))

# Datasets

- Our physiological dataset is on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cKdlVHbtEFtCn27FL5Rd48XlZ3Jpcu0d?usp=sharing).
- Our electron micrograph dataset is on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jSNdzvGJ1iILVb7oc5WIvaq_wu8Dd3nf?usp=sharing).
# Article

The draft is in [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tmw-pQONxzq4_XLAHJHkYRXw2BwvY5rJM9sBvxLX7Eg/edit).

# Tools

- A script to generate damaged images (and corresponding masks). Located in [this very repo](https://github.com/RomanPlusPlus/netReconst/tree/main/tools/damaged_images_generator)
- A comparison table of good inpaining projects. Located in [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LrYacRVBMC8ZzsBwXMXFWhlynn1z5kV-rNX372nbdYE/edit#gid=0)
