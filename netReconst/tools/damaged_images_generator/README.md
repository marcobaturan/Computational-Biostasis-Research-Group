damGen.py is a Python script that generates images with simulated cryo damage. For example, cracks and holes in the neural tissue.

The usage is simple:

0) [optionally] replace the input.png image with your own image
1) cd to the dir where the script is located
2) run the script

As the result, you'll get 5 "damaged" images, and 5 corresponding damage
masks.
